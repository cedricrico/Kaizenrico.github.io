       <p> 
         - I would like you too know that this is just a practice project
         plus i would love to give the credits to my teacher Mrs Briones
         for giving me this wonderful idea to what i am going to put in this html project that i am making 
         basically this site is just for self practices and the topic of this html is about my english class
         which getting a main idea and then supporting ideas such as facts and opinions 
         and yes this is just a self project and a real project for my english class so i have just thought
         what if i mixed those two task to make a project plus the html covers the topic for my english class 
         and my topic for my project in english class is about programming.
