              <h1>Margaret Hamilton</h1>

     <p>
            <br>Margaret Hamilton was a young plucky, 33-year old woman with glasses who liked,
            math. She was one of the few women at MIT’s Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, which in,
            the early 1960’s, was developing something important for NASA<br>. 

           <br>The Apollo and Skylab programs would mark a new era in space exploration. Hamilton,
            led the team that developed the in-flight software used to control the Apollo command,
            module, lunar lander, and eventually, the world’s first space station, Skylab.<br>
            
           <br> At a time when there were no computer science courses or software engineers,
            Hamilton was self-taught. Developing her skills with hands-on experience, she designed
            and developed recovery systems and error detection software. Her amazing efforts left
            fellow team-members dumbfounded.<br>
    
          <br>Without her contributions to the space program, there’s no telling where it might be
             today. Margaret Hamilton used code to change the world and conquer space. <br>

              <h1>William Henry Gates III</h1>

     <p>
         <br>
         William Henry Gates III - better known to the world as Bill - was born in October of 1955. By the time he was 13,
          he was fascinated by computers and took advantage of programs at his school to get access to the school’s computer systems. 
         <br>
          
         <br>
         He wrote games likes tic-tac-toe in BASIC and later,
          when he demonstrated his expertise in programming, 
          was enlisted to help a contractor for his school develop payroll programs and class scheduling software. 
         <br> 
                       
      <br> 
      In his words, it was “hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.”
      <br>
                                    
       <br>
       Eventually, he would take his programming knowledge and use it to capitalize on a new technology 
       that was quickly spreading across the globe—personal computers. 
       <br>                                    
                      
       <br>
       His idea was simple: Don’t make the machines, but make the software that runs them. 
       He went on to form Microsoft. The company would release Microsoft Windows, 
       a graphical interface for MS-DOS on November 20, 1985.

          <h1>From Dungeons and Demons to Steve</h1>

 <p>
        <br> Of the many types of video games created over the years, 
          you’re bound to see a few that are a little off-center. 
        <br>
  
  <br>
  The 1997 Electronic Arts classic Dungeon Keeper is an odd one. An interesting switch on the classic dungeon crawler, 
  the game puts you in the role of a dungeon master - of sorts - placing obstacles and building dungeons to protect your precious creation from invading heroes. 
  <br>


  <br>
  Then there is Dwarf Fortress, a freeware game, with three game modes, 
  all of which take place in worlds created by the player. The game’s Fortress mode is a construction and management sim,
   while Minecraft's Adventure mode is a turn-based adventure game. The Legends mode showcases player achievements.  
  <br>

  <br>
  Finally, Infiniminer was is a 3D isometric building game, 
  which feels a lot like a familiar block-building game that many kids know and love today.
  <br>


  <br>
  All three of these titles and their unique gameplay inspired a young programmer
  named Markus “Notch” Persson to create what is perhaps the most popular block-
  building game of all time—a title called Minecraft. The game has become a cultural and
  global phenomenon. And from a coding perspective, it has many educational benefits,
  and has become a catalyst to help introduce and teach kids programming. 
  “Notch,” didn’t set out to change the world, but he did in an unexpected way.

           <p>
        
       <br>AI or on a long term is called an artificial intellegence we used them day by day <br>

         <br> An AI is the ability of a machine to display human-like capabilities such as learning,reasoning,
          planning and even creativities<br>

                <br>AI enables technical systems to percieve their environment, deal with what they percieve,
                solve problems and act to achieve a specific goal.<br>

          <h1>The Father of Facebook</h1>

 <p>
  <br>Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, into a comfortable,
   well-educated family. He was raised in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry.<br>

   <br> Zuckerberg’s father, Edward Zuckerberg, ran a dental practice attached to the family's home.
   His mother, Karen, worked as a psychiatrist before the birth of the couple's four children — Mark,
    Randi, Donna and Arielle.<br>
  
    <br>Zuckerberg developed an interest in computers at an early age; when he was about 12, 
  he used Atari BASIC to create a messaging program he named "Zucknet." His father used the program in his dental office,
   so that the receptionist could inform him of a new patient without yelling across the room. The family also used Zucknet to communicate within the house.<br>
  
  <br> Together with his friends, he also created computer games just for fun. 
  "I had a bunch of friends who were artists," he said. "They'd come over, draw stuff,
   and I'd build a game out of it."<br>

   Facebook, American company offering online social networking services. Facebook was founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, all of whom were students at Harvard University. 
   Facebook became the largest social network in the world, with more than one billion users as of ...
